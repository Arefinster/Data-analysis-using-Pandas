**** Summary:

- This assignment is an exercise on the Pandas library using Jupyter Notebook. The data given includes math and reading scores of high school students from grades 9
through 12 from 15 schools classified as either Charter or District. The students are identified by their names, student IDs, genders, grades, school names and school 
IDs. The data also includes the size of the student population and the allocated yearly budget of each school.

**** Analysis Summary:

- The analysis is started off by computing the total number of schools, total budget, average math and reading scores, and overall passing rates across all the schools. 
- The analysis then dives deeper into computing the average math and reading scores and the overall passing rates of the students by school types, school populations, 
school budgets and grades.
- A summary table for the computations are generated.

**** Analytical Conclusions:

- Results show that regardless of the per student budget allocated across all the schools, students in Charter schools have done much better than the students 
in District schools. Charter school students have done better in both math and reading and also have higher passing rate than that of the District school students.
That being said, most Charter schools have lower per student budget allocation as compared to that allocated for the District school students.

- Results also show that school population size can also impact the performance of the students. Schools with population sizes from medium to small or smaller have had 
higher average math and reading scores and also higher overall passing rates than those with larger population sizes. Interestingly, most Charter schools have medium 
to smaller population sizes than the district schools. 

- Highest performing schools are all Charter and the lowest performing schools are all District.

- Analyses indicate that with smaller student population, teachers in the Charter schools may be able to engage more closely with the students resulting in better student 
performances.

NOTE: I have worked on this assignment alone. I did get help from the w3schools.com site for systax. I also used several other tutorial sites I found from Google.
Finally, I consulted with the Learning Assistants from BCS a couple of times.
